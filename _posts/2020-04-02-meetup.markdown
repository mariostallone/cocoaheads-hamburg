We're going to have talks.
Updates will follow. 😎

**When?**

Thurday, 02.04.2020, 19:00

**Where?**

REMOTE!

As all of you know, we're stuck at home due to Corona Virus 🦠. 

About that, we hope you're all safe and healthy, as well as you family and friends! 

To keep you all distracted and to be able to talk about our favorite nerd topics, we're not going to give up on our monthly meetup! 💪🏼

We planned to host the meeting on zoom this time and have so called "Breakout Rooms" to make even the socializing and networking part of the event possible.
This is the first time for us organizing something like this, so bare with us!

Also, advices and tipps from you are very welcome! 🙏🏼 

Please follow the following zoom link to join the meeting:
ZOOM LINK WILL BE ADDED HERE
